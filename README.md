# README

This is the demo app used in my talk "Background Jobs in Rails" hosted at [RailsGirlsTO](https://www.meetup.com/railsgirlsTO/events/239808299/).

You can find the slides [here](https://github.com/jennaleeb/automom/blob/master/BackgroundJobs.pdf).

### Some setup to play around with the demo app

1. `git clone https://github.com/jennaleeb/automom.git`

2. Make a file in your root called `.env` (this will be for storing your super secret environment variables like your email password and API keys)

3. Set up your email client according to the ActionMailer [config instructions](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#action-mailer-configuration) 

4. Make an account at https://darksky.net/dev/

5. ...

6. Profit
